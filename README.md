# Infinite Scroll â€” Unsplash API Demo

An implementation built with vanilla JavaScript that uses the Unsplash API to fetch and display photos in an infinite scroll.

## Features

- Fetches 30 random photos at a time from the Unsplash API to display.
- Scroll to fetch more photos and check out the illusion of an infinite scroll!

## Caveats

This demo is limited to 50 requests per hour and the API key is visible. I don't care that it gets compromised because of that limitation, again, is just a demo.

If the app isn't working correctly is because of this caveat, come back later so the app can fetch new photos again eventually.

If you are building a production ready app using the Unsplash API, please check out the [Unsplash documentation](https://unsplash.com/documentation), create an account and apply for production yourself to have access to 5,000 requests per hour.
